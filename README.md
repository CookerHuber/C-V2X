CV2XMode4.m is the main script you have to run to get the PDR curve as a function of the distance for a given set of parameters. This script is related to the rest of scripts following the following diagram:

     CV2XMode4.m
         |---->   CV2XMode4_common.m   ----> get_PL_SH.m, get_SINRdistribution.m, get_BLER.m
         |---->   CV2XMode4_Step2.m    ----> get_PL_SH.m, get_SINRdistribution.m, get_BLER.m
         |---->   CV2XMode4_Step3.m    ----> get_PL_SH.m, get_SINRdistribution.m, get_BLER.m
         
If you want to run the same configurations than the ones in the paper, you could simply run the script run_all.m

The resulting figures are compared with simulations when the same configuration is available in the ./simulations folder.

The resulting figures are stored in the ./fig folder.

The equations in this code that appear in the paper are shown with their number in brackets so that they can be easily identified in the paper.
