The paper presents analytical models for the average PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver, and for the four different types of transmission errors that can be encountered in C-V2X Mode 4. The models are validated for a wide range of transmission parameters and traffic densities. To this aim, this study compares the results obtained with the analytical models to those obtained with a C-V2X Mode 4 simulator implemented over Veins. 

CV2XMode4.m is the main script you have to run to get the PDR and the probability of each of the four transmission errorscurve as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver. This script is related to the rest of scripts as described in the following diagram:

     CV2XMode4.m
         |---->   CV2XMode4_common.m   ----> get_PL_SH.m, get_SINRdistribution.m, get_BLER.m
         |---->   CV2XMode4_Step2.m    ----> get_PL_SH.m, get_SINRdistribution.m, get_BLER.m
         |---->   CV2XMode4_Step3.m    ----> get_PL_SH.m, get_SINRdistribution.m, get_BLER.m
         
If you want to run the same configurations than the ones in the paper, you could simply run the script run_all.m

The resulting figures are compared with simulations when the same configuration is available in the ./simulations folder.

The resulting figures are stored in the ./fig folder.

The equations in this code that appear in the paper are shown with their number in brackets so that they can be easily identified in the paper.
